infix expression checker
=============================================

I Implement a program for evaluating infix expressions. The program read
an infix expression from a text file, checked if the parentheses in the input expression are
balanced and converted the infix expression into a postfix expression, and then evaluate that
postfix expression.

+ Reviewing project.cpp should explain how everything works
+ Other files for testing and project requirements


Comes complete with tests!
