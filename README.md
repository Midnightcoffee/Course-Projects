Every wounder which state is the happiest? In this assignment we:

+ Access the Twitter Programming Interface(API) using Python.
+ We estimate the public's perception (the sentiment) of a particular term or phrase.
+ analyzed the relationship between location and mood based on a sample of twitter data.

Dijstra's Algorithm
=============================================================================

 + Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1
 + Stanford University
 + Class Certification: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1C_HgqJ_YTrQmhHVWcxWnVJUTA/edit?usp=sharing

I coded up some great unit-tests and test visualizers for my online
class mates. Take a look at the read me in the file for more!


Linear Algebra ... with code??!?
==============================================================================

+ LinearAlgebra.py
+ Coding the Matrix: Linear Algebra through Computer Science
+ Brown University
+ Class Certification: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1C_HgqJ_YTrajRtZ1dzemkyVkE/edit?usp=sharing

Think back to linear Algebra... to painful? This file gives a sample of
how we used python to explore orthogonalization. Later we used these concepts
to shrink an image... Pretty cool.


Depth-first Search VS Source Removal ... FIGHT!
==========================================================================

+ toplogy/
+ Algorithms Design and analysis 
+ Wayne State (you caught me this isn't an online class)
+ Degree expected 2014

This directory explains in code which algorithm has the better running time. 
For the break down check the readme. I employed 
some rather unorthodox methods in both algorithms. For instance, my DFS and
source removal both employ sets to keep track of visited nodes. For what I
analyzed to be a minor time benefit.










Where is the rest?
=====================
Didn't you do a lot more? Yes, I did. But in reviewing my work I realized
that it wouldn't be fair to other student to leave all my MOOC class work
exposed. Furthermore its fairly distracting as 80% of it is template files
and data files! On top of that 80% of udacity work was just done in-broswer.
