Course Projects
===========================
This is a collection of projects from various classes, both online and
at my University.

Using Twitter to find the happiest state
==============================================================================


+ Folder: Data_Science/
+ Check The ReadMe: For how To run the code and discover for yourself which state is happiest
+ Class: Introduction to Data science Through Coursera
+ Washington University
+ Class Certification: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1C_HgqJ_YTrQmYyakdrWXdvV1E/edit?usp=sharing

This code

+ Access the Twitter Programming Interface(API) using Python.
+ estimates the public's perception (the sentiment) of a particular term or phrase.
+ analyzes the relationship between location and mood based on a sample of twitter data.

* The sample size is MUCH to small in order to fit within githubs suggested file size.


Machine Learning
=============================================================================

+ machine_learning.m
+ Machine Learning
+ Stanford University
+ No Certification yet - class in progress

This code is accomplishes Vectorized backpropagation, which allows for a
better trained Neural Network.

Dijstra's Algorithm
=============================================================================


+ dijkstra/
+ Check the infile readme for how to create your own test cases.
+ Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1
+ Stanford University
+ Class Certification: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1C_HgqJ_YTrQmhHVWcxWnVJUTA/edit?usp=sharing

I had learned this algorithm in an early class so i jumped on the
opportunity to code up a test_generator.py that produce test_files and
an accompanying graph so you could get a better idea what went wrong
Take a look at the Readme in the file for more!


Peak Finding Algorithm
=============================================================================
+ peak_finding/
+ description [here](http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.006/spring11/rec/rec02.pdf)
+ 6006: algorithms
+ MIT
+ I completed all the lectures and I'm currently about halfway through the
assignments.

MIT 6006 is a goldmine of information. [Erik Demaine](http://erikdemaine.org/classes/) 
is my hero. This fuled my passion for algorithms. Ok enough sentiment. Peak finding
is a great exercises becuase there are so many ways to do it. Try it ourself!

Linear Algebra ... with code??!?
==============================================================================


+ linear_algebra.py
+ I was class Promoted to class Teacher Assistant
+ Coding the Matrix: Linear Algebra through Computer Science
+ Brown University
+ Class Certification: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1C_HgqJ_YTrajRtZ1dzemkyVkE/edit?usp=sharing

Think back to linear Algebra... to painful? This file gives a sample of
how we used python to explore orthogonalization. Later we used these concepts
to shrink an image... Pretty cool stuff!


Algorithm Analysis: DFS vs Source Removal
==========================================================================

+ topology/
+ Check infile readme for how to run the code
+ Algorithms Design and Analysis
+ Wayne State
+ Degree expected Dec, 2014

The code in directory explains which algorithm has the better running time
By using Pythons Timeit module. For the final score check the Readme. I employed
some rather unorthodox data structures in both algorithms. For instance, my DFS and
source removal both benefit from a slight running time boost from using sets
to keep track of visited nodes.


Infix expression checker
===========================================================================

+ infix_expression/
+ Computer Programing: Data Structures in C++
+ Wayne State
+ Degree expected Dec, 2014 2014

I Implement a program for evaluating infix expressions. The program read
an infix expression from a text file, checked if the parentheses in the input expression are
balanced and converted the infix expression into a postfix expression, and then evaluate that
postfix expression.

Comes complete with tests!

Software Testing
=========================================================================
+ random_testing.py
+ software testing class
+ Udacity

This class covered, coverage testing, code coverage, random testing and
a whole lot more. It might be the only online class focused on testing.
While many of the techinques are overkill for my small projects there 
are definatly concepts they were definatly concepts that will be useful 
on future larger projects. 

Is your credit card valid?
========================================================================
Where is the rest?
=====================
Didn't you do a lot more? Yes, I did. But for Honor Code reasons I thought it
best to not leave it all public.
