===========================

Some samples from my favorite online classes!

Dijstra's Algorithm
======================================================
 + dijkstra.py
 + Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1
 + Stanford University

What a great algorithm. I had the chance to learn this one in Udacities A
lgorithm class so I dived
right into making some really cool unit-tests and test visualizers for my Online
class mates. Take a look at the read me in the file for more!

Which State is the happiest?
==============================================================================================
+ happiest_state.py -
+ Introduction to Data science
+ Washington

Every wounder which state is the happiest? In this assignment we:

+ Access the Twitter Programming Interface(API) using Python.
+ We estimate the public's perception (the sentiment) of a particular term or phrase.
+ analyzed the relationship between location and mood based on a sample of twitter data.




Where is the rest?
=====================
Didn't you do a lot more? Yes, I did. But in reviewing my work I realized
that it wouldn't be fair to other student to leave all my MOOC class work
exposed. Furthermore its fairly distracting as 80% of it is template files
and data files!
