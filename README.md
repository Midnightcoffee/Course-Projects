Course Projects
===========================
This is a collection of projects from various classes, both online and
at my University. 
Big Data -- Which State is the happiest?
==============================================================================

+ happiest_state.py
+ Introduction to Data science
+ Washington University
+ Class Certification: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1C_HgqJ_YTrQmYyakdrWXdvV1E/edit?usp=sharing 

Every wounder which state is the happiest? In this assignment we:

+ Access the Twitter Programming Interface(API) using Python.
+ We estimate the public's perception (the sentiment) of a particular term or phrase.
+ analyzed the relationship between location and mood based on a sample of twitter data.


Machine Learning
=============================================================================

+ machineLearning.m
+ Machine Learning
+ Stanford University
+ No Certification yet - class in progress

In this lab I coded up Vectorized backpropagation which allowed us to train
our Neural Network. From this we were able to get a better prediction. Addtional
I got to sharpen my octave and Linear Agebra skills


Dijstra's Algorithm
=============================================================================

 + dijkstra.py
 + Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1
 + Stanford University
 + Class Certification: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1C_HgqJ_YTrQmhHVWcxWnVJUTA/edit?usp=sharing

I coded up some great unit-tests and test visualizers for my online
class mates. Take a look at the read me in the file for more!


Linear Algebra ... with code??!?
==============================================================================

+ LinearAlgebra.py
+ Coding the Matrix: Linear Algebra through Computer Science
+ Brown University
+ Class Certification: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1C_HgqJ_YTrajRtZ1dzemkyVkE/edit?usp=sharing

Think back to linear Algebra... to painful? This file gives a sample of
how we used python to explore orthogonalization. Later we used these concepts
to shrink an image... Pretty cool.


Depth-first Search VS Source Removal ... FIGHT!
==========================================================================

+ toplogy/
+ Algorithms Design and analysis 
+ Wayne State 
+ Degree expected 2014

This directory explains in code which algorithm has the better running time. 
For the break down check the readme. I employed 
some rather unorthodox methods in both algorithms. For instance, my DFS and
source removal both employ sets to keep track of visited nodes. For what I
analyzed to be a minor time benefit.


Infix expression checker
===========================================================================

+ infix_expression/
+ Computer Programing: Data Structures in C++
+ Wayne State
+ Degree expected 2014

I Implement a program for evaluating infix expressions. The program read
an infix expression from a text file, checked if the parentheses in the input expression are
balanced and converted the infix expression into a postfix expression, and then evaluate that
postfix expression.

Comes complete with tests! 

Where is the rest?
=====================
Didn't you do a lot more? Yes, I did. But for Honor Code reasons I thought it
best to not leave it all public.
