Course Projects
===========================
This is a collection of projects from various classes, both online and
at my University.

Using Twitter to find the happiest state
==============================================================================

+ Data_Science/
+ Introduction to Data science
+ Washington University
+ Class Certification: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1C_HgqJ_YTrQmYyakdrWXdvV1E/edit?usp=sharing
+ Check The ReadMe: For how To run the code and discover for yourself

Every wounder which state is the happiest? This code tries to find out. It

+ Access the Twitter Programming Interface(API) using Python.
+ We estimate the public's perception (the sentiment) of a particular term or phrase.
+ analyzed the relationship between location and mood based on a sample of twitter data.


Machine Learning
=============================================================================

+ machine_learning.m
+ Machine Learning
+ Stanford University
+ No Certification yet - class in progress

Vectorized backpropagation which allowed for a better trained Neural Network.

Dijstra's Algorithm
=============================================================================

 + dijkstra/
 + Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1
 + Stanford University
 + Class Certification: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1C_HgqJ_YTrQmhHVWcxWnVJUTA/edit?usp=sharing

I had learned this algorithm in an early class so i jumped on the
opportunity to code up a test_generator.py that produce test_files and
an accompanying graph so you could get a better idea what went wrong
Take a look at the Readme in the file for more!


Linear Algebra ... with code??!?
==============================================================================

+ linear_algebra.py
+ Coding the Matrix: Linear Algebra through Computer Science
+ Brown University
+ I was class TA
+ Class Certification: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1C_HgqJ_YTrajRtZ1dzemkyVkE/edit?usp=sharing

Think back to linear Algebra... to painful? This file gives a sample of
how we used python to explore orthogonalization. Later we used these concepts
to shrink an image... Pretty cool stuff!


Algorithm Analysis: DFS vs Source Removal
==========================================================================

+ Algorithms Design and Analysis
+ Wayne State
+ Degree expected Dec, 2014

The code in directory explains which algorithm has the better running time
By using Pythongs Timeit module.For the final score check the Readme. I employed
some rather unorthodox data structures in both algorithms. For instance, my DFS and
source removal both benefit from a slight running time boost from using sets
to keep track of visited nodes.


Infix expression checker
===========================================================================

+ infix_expression/
+ Computer Programing: Data Structures in C++
+ Wayne State
+ Degree expected Dec, 2014 2014

I Implement a program for evaluating infix expressions. The program read
an infix expression from a text file, checked if the parentheses in the input expression are
balanced and converted the infix expression into a postfix expression, and then evaluate that
postfix expression.

Comes complete with tests!

Where is the rest?
=====================
Didn't you do a lot more? Yes, I did. But for Honor Code reasons I thought it
best to not leave it all public.
